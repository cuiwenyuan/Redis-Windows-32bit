# Redis-Windows-32bit
The Windows 32-bit bin files for Redis can download here.

Some times we have to deploy our application on OLD Windows 32-bit OS. Just because the MSOpenTech(https://github.com/MSOpenTech/redis) only support 64-bit version, we have to compile our ourself. Now you can SAVE your time download here.

# How to?

Please copy the following files in different folder to your server:

    - redis-server.exe
    - redis-benchmark.exe
    - redis-cli.exe
    - redis-check-dump.exe
    - redis-check-aof.exe
    - redis.windows.conf
    - redis.windows-service.conf - setup your Redis server
    - service-install.bat - run this to install as Windows service
    - uninstall-service.bat - remove Windows service
